Output recorded from autoflow-coordinator `tools/status.py` at v0.7.0-rc2 (commit 988011d), the supported version:

- `status-run.json`: a run directory named `autoflow-sandbox-3-sample` (the coordinator's `<repo>-<issue>-<key>` form) with run.env (`ISSUE=3`, `TERMINAL=tmux`), two sessions in sessions.tsv whose claude processes are gone, and three rows in runbook.md's progress table (a pass, a missed verdict and a noted one).
- `status-error.json`: a run directory without run.env.
- `status-none.json`: no active runs.
